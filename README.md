# Data Analytics and Prediction with Fisher Iris Dataset
Supervised and Unsupervised learning algorithms to classify the species and to analyze the performance of different classification algorithms.\
Employed supervised learning algorithms Gaussian Naïve Bayes
and logistic regression to classify the data.The unsupervised
Learning algorithm K-means was also employed.Furthermore,
an attempt to explain the misclassification was done by employing
PCA and when reduced to 3 dimensions , the closeness of the
different samples when plotted explained why k means didn’t show
a good precision or recall, because it forms spherical clusters
